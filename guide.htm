<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><br>
The primary reason for the popularity and freshness of EAW
today is due to the large number of excellent user enhancements and add-ons
available.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The scope and depth of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>these add-ons is amazing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Pilots
can choose from dozens of planes and fly in many different theaters and
campaigns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Whether you want a Zero
in the Pacific, a Yak in the Eastern Front, or just a Spitfire over the Channel,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>there’s something for everyone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Improvements
have come in almost every area and its not slowing down either!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">With all these excellent add-ons available, it can be a bit
overwhelming to someone just starting their pilot career in EAW.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Its almost like buying several flight sims together and trying figure
them all out at once.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Well, to help you get in the air as quickly as possible while
still experiencing some of the best EAW has to offer, I’ve put together what I
call the “Classic EAW Guide”.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><font size="3">This guide will help you build out an improved EAW that is
based on the original European theater, planes, and terrain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is a big improvement from what you get out of the box, but still has
the flavor and charm of the original EAW.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
recommend this as a good starting point, then you can move on to all the other
wonderful add-ons depending on your areas of interest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">Note: I have provided links to the various
add-ons and/or sites, just click on them and you're set.&nbsp; If a link appears
to be broken, check <a href="http://www.sandbaggereaw.com/">Sandbagger's
site</a>, where you can find alternate sites for
most of these.</o:p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#006600"><font size="3">EAW version 1.2</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p>Start with the 1.2 patch.&nbsp; If you don't already have this with your copy
of EAW, you can get it from <a href="http://eaw.furballcentral.com">Cord's
EAW Page</a> under Utilities/Patches.&nbsp; Next, get <font size="3"> <a href="downloads/eaw2000.zip">EAW Control 2000</a> by Alan
White.&nbsp; It lets you set the all-important resolution and Extra Squads
settings from a nice gui interface.&nbsp; Otherwise, you can check the 1.2
readme and set these directly by editing the eaw.ini file.<o:p>
&nbsp;
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><b>Resolution</b>-<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>don’t
get stuck using 640x480 resolution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I recommend 1280x1024 or
1280x960 if your system can handle it as the field of view is close to
the default.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; You may want to try
different settings to see how they work out.&nbsp; </span>Be aware your FOV changes depending on the resolution.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><b>Extra Squads</b> -<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>this
adds additional squadrons of planes to each mission, and is also set in the
eaw.ini file.&nbsp; See the 1.2 documentation for details.&nbsp;&nbsp; I like to
use a value of 3.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is not uncommon to see well over 100 planes in an
engagement with this option set.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><b>Realism</b>-<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Fly
full realism!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You will have
problems at first with stalling and spinning, but this is what makes the
difference between an arcade game and a sim.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You will get the hang of things with a little practice.&nbsp; And if you 
don't have rudder controls of some type, you will want to get them, whether its 
rudder pedals or a twist joystick.&nbsp; Myself, I'm very happy with the MS 
Precision Pro 2.</font></p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#006600"><font size="3">SKINS</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">The ability to customize aircraft is what started the first
of all the EAW mods.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Literally
hundreds of beautiful skins exist which include almost every plane you
could ever want<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I won’t
suggest any specific skins, but here are some good sites to check out by some
very talented EAW skinners.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Its
easy to go crazy downloading skins, I’d just start out with one or two
favorite skins for each model of the original planes.</font>
</p>
<p><font size="3"><a href="http://mosi.furballcentral.com">Mosi's Flightsim Page</a>
- Many beautiful skins of all kinds of planes.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Launchpad/4145/">Migge's EAW
Pages</a> - Migge has been around a long time with a ton of beautiful skins.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><a href="http://www.acesrising.com/index.html">Aces Rising</a>
-&nbsp; Julio has many absolutely beautiful Bf-109Es and Fw-190As as well as
others.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><a href="http://www.sandbaggeruk.com/flyingsheep.html">Flying Sheep's Flugwerke</a>
- Some very nice skins of many different planes.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><a href="http://www.the-hangar.net/">The Hanger</a> - A
very large collection of skins from various artists.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#006600"><font size="3">TERRAIN</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">I am a big fan of the look of original EAW terrain for the
European Theater.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But, out of the
box, there is room for improvement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; To 
start, g</span>et the
cleaned-up and enhanced version <a href="downloads/sum_hr.zip">Hi-Res Summer EAW
Terrain</a> from this site.&nbsp; You will also want to pick up the <a href="downloads/sum_field.zip">Summer Airfields</a>
to match.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">EAW has hills and mountains, but by default they are so
subtle, you may hardly notice them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dominique
LeGrande has come up with a way to increase the scale of the hills and mountains
so that things look really nice and natural.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span> <a href="downloads/HillyEAWWorld.zip">Hilly
EAW World</a> is a good fit for the European terrain.</font></p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#006600"><font size="3">SKY</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">As a st<font size="3">art, download the <a href="downloads/skyclouds.zip">EAW
Sky and Clouds</a> add-on from
this site.&nbsp; It includes a new sky, clouds, and sun.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#006600"><font size="3">EFFECTS</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">A popular add-on is the <a href="downloads/effects.zip">
EAW Effects Pack</a><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">. </span>This provides 
better-looking smoke, fire, flak, and tracers.&nbsp; Also check the download 
page for the <a href="downloads/flames.zip">Flames Enhancement</a> mod.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#006600"><font size="3">SOUNDS</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">Several people have created add-on sounds for EAW that are
a big improvement over the standard sounds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><a href="http://www.meatwater.com/fs_freestuff.htm">Meatwater’s EAW
SoundPack</a> was the first and is still very popular.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
Some other very good sounds that are preferred by many people are also available
in the sound section at </span></font><a href="http://serbs.free.fr/">Serb's EAW flightline</a>.&nbsp;
Or, I have zipped up a collection of the sounds that I like, which is a
combination of sounds from both Meatwater and Serb, as well as a few I have
adapted from other sources.&nbsp; You can download it <a href="downloads/sounds.zip">here</a>.</p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#006600"><font size="3">FLIGHT MODELS</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">Hakan Langebro and Charles Gunst have teamed up to create
the most accurate flight models for all the original planes in EAW.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The package is called <a href="downloads/ecao14.ZIP">Enemy
Coast Ahead Online 1.4</a>.&nbsp; The install for ECAO is very easy, just unzip all the files into your EAW
directory.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#006600"><font size="3">OTHER</font> <!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">A couple other mods you will want are the&nbsp; <a href="downloads/GRN%20File%20Upgrades.zip">hi-res
objects</a> provided by Redeyes and the <a href="downloads/3dforestkill.zip">3D
Forest Kill</a> by HarryM.&nbsp; This hi-res objects give you better detail in
the buildings and ground objects, while the 3D Forest Kill eliminates the ugly
3D forests.&nbsp; Just unzip and copy the files from both these downloads into
your EAW directory.</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">In addition, I recommend the <a href="downloads/rendermod.zip">
EAW Plane Rendering Mod</a> download from this site, which increases the detail 
and clarity at which you can see planes at a distance.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">Finally, just a pointer to help you really enjoy the game
even more.&nbsp; Make sure you make liberal use of F9 (cycles through all
planes) and F12 (movie mode) to look around at the action.&nbsp; If you're not in the heat of
battle, you can put your plane on autopilot and watch the action unfold, or just
admire the view.&nbsp; Use the mouse to move around and zoom in and out.&nbsp; I find myself spending as much time just looking around
this way as actually flying.&nbsp; Just like watching a good WWII movie!</font></p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#006600"><font size="3">Beyond the basics&nbsp;</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">Once you start getting a collection of skins, cockpits,
seasonal terrains, gunsights, sounds, and other stuff, you will quickly see the need of having
something to keep track of it all.&nbsp; I am very fond of Relent's <a href="http://www.sonic.net/jcam/eawskins/">Skins-n-More</a>
utility,&nbsp; MattM also has a popular program called
<a href="downloads/EAWStab40.zip">STAB</a>.&nbsp;
Both are both excellent programs that will solve this problem for you, and also have very helpful tutorials available.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"> If
your interests lie outside of the original planes provided in EAW, you will
definately want to get Enemy Coast Ahead and ECA Panel by Charles Gunst.&nbsp;
This is an
amazing piece of work that models and lets you fly over 200 aircraft.&nbsp;&nbsp;You
can get these from <a href="http://www.users.bigpond.net.au/CharlesEAW/">Charles'
EAW Website</a>.</font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">There are a wide range of campaigns, terrains, skins, and speech packs
that have been made
for many different theaters not originally available in EAW.&nbsp; Even the
European theater campaigns have been enhanced and improved.&nbsp; Emil has
produced many excellent new and enhanced campaigns for EAW, all available from
his site <a href="http://emil.free.fr/">Emil's</a></font><a href="http://emil.free.fr/home.htm">
EAW Campaigns</a>.&nbsp; <font size="3">I could go on
forever with add-ons, but I will direct you
to the <a href="links.htm">links page</a> for a good starting point of what else
is available.&nbsp; The amount of excellent add-ons of every
type is truly amazing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you have an interest in on-line flying, please check out 
the EAW forum on <a href="http://www.simhq.com">www.simhq.com</a> for the latest 
activity in the on-line EAW community.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">I also have to put a plug in for Desert Air
War, a comprehensive add-on that models the N. Africa and Mediterranean theater,
complete with new terrain, planes, in-game screens, campaigns, and more.&nbsp;
You can visit the DAW page on my site <a href="daw/index.htm">here</a>.</font></p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#006600"><font size="3"><a name="Running EAW under WindowsXP">Running EAW under WindowsXP</a></font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p><font size="3">Yes, with some tweaking, EAW should work fine with WinXP!&nbsp; 
There are a few important things you need to be aware of:</font></p>
<p>XP Updates- <font size="3">&nbsp;make sure you
have XP Service Pack 1 or later installed.&nbsp; 
The Service Packs will automatically install the latest Application Compatability Update, which contains a custom profile for EAW that will allow it 
to work properly.&nbsp; DO NOT manually change the compatability mode using the 
compatability tab,
or it will override the custom profile and cause problems with your joystick and
keyboard in the game.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><a name="Video Drivers"></a>Video Driver Updates-&nbsp; If you have an Nvidia 
GeForce card, forget what you know about always upgrading to the latest driver.&nbsp; 
For EAW you must use a driver version 66.93 or earlier.&nbsp; Anything later 
will give you the dreaded Error 7217.&nbsp; I recommend you stick with version 
66.93, as it is the latest EAW-friendly driver.&nbsp; You can get it from Nvidia
<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/winxp_2k_66.93.html">here</a>.&nbsp; 
Warning!- some newer games require a driver later than version 66.93.&nbsp; If 
so, you may break those games if you &quot;downgrade&quot; to 66.93.&nbsp; Nvidia has been 
made aware of the problem, but there is no promise of a fix.&nbsp; I often try 
later drivers when they come out, only to end up going back to 66.93.</p>
<p><font size="3">Installation-&nbsp; If you are still having problems after 
updating to SP1, uninstall and reinstall EAW.&nbsp; I</font>f you have the version of EAW with the 1.2 patch on CD, and are 
 
getting the error &quot;eaw.exe is not a valid Win 32 application&quot;, ignore the 
CD instructions and run the 1.2 update immediately after installing EAW.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Add-ons- <font size="3">&nbsp;the main EAW executable has to be named eaw.exe to be recognized properly.&nbsp;
If you are using a add-on version that names it something else (eaw12a.exe), you will
need to rename it to eaw.exe. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">Joystick-&nbsp; If you are having problems getting your joystick to work or be 
recognized, here are some tips.&nbsp; First, make sure you did not manually 
check any compatability mode checkboxes for eaw.exe.&nbsp; You should rely 
entirely on the MS Compatability Update to automatically set the options.&nbsp; 
Also, check the settings under the Game Controllers icon in the WindowsXP 
Control Panel.&nbsp; Click on the Advanced button and make sure the Preferred 
Device is the appropriate joystick.&nbsp; Finally, if the joystick is acting 
erratic in the game, go
into the eaw.ini file and find the line that says &quot;Windows
Joystick=0&quot;.&nbsp; Change the value to 1 (or 0 if its already 1)&nbsp; and
see if that clears it up.</font></p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#006600"><font size="3">Special Notes for GeForce Owners</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">As explained in the section
<a href="#Video Drivers">above,</a> you will want to stick with version 66.93 of 
the Nvidia drivers.&nbsp; I recommend you enable d3d anisotropic filtering to 
minimize terrain shimmering, it makes a huge difference in image quality.&nbsp; Also, there is finally a fix for the corrupted
briefing and map screens, the infamous &quot;GeForce Bug.&quot;&nbsp; Detailed
information on both of these issues and their fixes is available on the <a href="downloads.htm">downloads</a> 
page.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#006600"><font size="3">Error 7217</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p>There are a couple common causes of Error 7217 on startup.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Nvidia GeForce graphics cards-&nbsp; if you have an Nvidia GeForce card and 
are getting this error, your video card drivers are probably too new.&nbsp; You 
must backrev to version 66.93.&nbsp; See <a href="#Video Drivers">above</a> for 
more info.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Intel graphics chipsets-&nbsp; if your computer has an Intel 810/815/830/845 family chipset, 
you will probably get the Error 7217.&nbsp; This is a common on-board 
graphics chip that is found in many newer, inexpensive computers.&nbsp;  
The only way to solve this is to use an add-on graphics card and disable the 
on-board video.&nbsp; A graphics card like a low-end Nvidia Geforce series 
(which is still better than any on-board Intel chip) can be had for less than 
$50 if you shop around.&nbsp; If you don't have an on-board Intel graphics chip 
and still get this error, make sure you have the latest Microsoft DirectX and 
drivers for your video card.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#006600"><font size="3">Other Common Issues</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p>ATI Radeon Card-&nbsp; EAW will work on a Radeon card, but it will not be 
able to display any horizon fog (there will be a sharp boundary between sky and 
ground) which detracts from the visual quality.&nbsp; Also, the briefing screens 
will be garbled.&nbsp; There is no known fix for either issue.</p>
<p>Windows 2000-&nbsp; If you somehow get EAW to run on Win2k, consider yourself 
lucky.</p>
<p>Other problems-&nbsp; If you are having other problems running EAW, the best 
place to get help is the EAW forum on <a href="http://www.simhq.com">
www.simhq.com</a>.&nbsp;
&nbsp;Don't be afraid to post any question no matter how stupid or obscure it 
may seem.&nbsp; There are plenty of friendly people willing to help and the 
combined EAW knowledge on the board is enormous. </p>
