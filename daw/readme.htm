<p align="center">DESERT AIR WAR<br>
Version 1.1<br>
AN ADD-ON PACKAGE FOR<br>
MICROPROSE'S EUROPEAN AIR WAR</p>
<p>1. Introduction</p>
<p>Desert Air War (&quot;DAW&quot;) contains a comprehensive set of files which
enable you to simulate, with a fair degree of realism, the air war over the
Western Desert in North Africa in 1941-1942, using Microprose's EAW.</p>
<p>DAW can be played either in single missions, or by using a specially-written
desert campaign. However, DAW creates a theatre of war which extends beyond
North Africa to Malta, Sicily, Crete and Greece, and we hope that further
campaigns will become available to take advantage of this new setting for our
favourite game.</p>
<p>As well as a complete new &quot;world&quot; for EAW, DAW features a greater
emphasis on attacks against convoys and ground troops than in previous EAW
add-ons.</p>
<p>DAW is a group project, put together by the following people:</p>
<p>&quot;Dancho&quot; Dan Dunn Hangar screens<br>
&quot;Emil&quot; Campaign files<br>
&quot;max188&quot; Matt Magleby Terrain tiles, runways<br>
&quot;Mosi&quot; Christian Mosimann Skins, selection screens<br>
&quot;P.O. Prune&quot; Stephen O'Leary Terrain layout, some screens<br>
&quot;Pobs&quot; Brian Egan 3D objects and textures</p>
<p>Any of us can be reached through the EAW Forum at SimHQ, on:</p>
<p>http://www.simhq.com/<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>2. Installation</p>
<p>· The Desert Air War add-on requires a separate, clean installation of EAW.
You can easily do this by installing EAW from CD and selecting a directory path
for the DAW installation that is different from your original EAW directory.
This way you can be sure that no files from other campaigns, addons or skinpacks
are &quot;'contaminating&quot; your new DAW installation.<br>
<br>
· Patch EAW to version 1.1, 1.2 or 1.2a, according to your preference.<br>
<br>
· Copy the files contained in all the .zip files you downloaded EXCEPT FOR
MISSIONS.ZIP into your DAW main directory. Say yes to overwriting files with the
same name in your directory.<br>
<br>
· Copy all the files from Missions.zip into the Savedata sub-directory of your
DAW main directory. (If you don't, you may get a crash to desktop when you try
to start a mission.) If you don't have a Savedata subdirectory, you may need to
start the game once for this directory to be automatically created.<br>
<br>
· Run the make_bn.bat file (copied over with the terrain download) to create
all the necessary terrain files.<br>
<br>
· If you want to fly a campaign you may want to rename PlanesUK.dat or
PlanesGR.dat to Planes.dat first. To fly only single missions this renaming is
not necessary. See 'Known Problems' below for a better explanation.<br>
<br>
· Start the game and verify that the installation is working okay. If you
started from a clean installation, you should encounter no problems.<br>
<br>
· At this point you can introduce additional add-ons according to your
preference. But be VERY careful, as many add-ons will overwrite the DAW files
and give undesirable results. You should be safe with add-ons like sound packs,
sky files, effects pack, or gunsites. DO NOT use ECA Panel after installation of
DAW, or all campaign-specific files will be overwritten.</p>
<p>That's it!<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>3. Limitations</p>
<p>It was never our intention to attempt to re-create the rapidly-moving front
lines of the desert war. We have therefore had to adopt a compromise in setting
out the front lines and target locations for DAW.</p>
<p>The North African theatre is depicted in DAW as it was for the majority of
the campaign, from the beginning of May 1941 until the Allied retreat to el
Alamein in June 1942. Rommel has carried out his first lightning attack into
Cyrenaica, but Tobruk is holding out against him. The front line between the two
armies lies between Sollum and Sidi Barrani. The ground troops, however, are
shown in approximately the positions they held at the start of the CRUSADER
offensive in November 1941.</p>
<p>Crete is shown as held by the Axis. However, we may at some point in the
future produce a variant in which Crete is held by the Allies, with a view to
creating a (largely hypothetical) Cretan campaign.</p>
<p>The European mainland and islands, and the Egyptian delta, are depicted in a
&quot;Mediterranean&quot; style, unlike the &quot;desert&quot; style used for
the rest of North Africa. Because there is a limited number of terrain tiles
available in EAW, no rivers are shown in Sicily or Greece (there are very few
rivers there anyway).</p>
<p>The ground forces, the convoys at sea and the aircraft carriers do not move.</p>
<p>DAW is intended for use in offline playing modes (campaign, single mission,
instant action.) Using the DAW add-on in an online environment has not been
tested.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>4. Known problems</p>
<p>1) When flying single missions the default Planes.dat can be used. However
when using the default Planes.dat in a campaign, enemy bombers will sometimes be
unescorted on intercept missions. This usually results in an unexciting 'turky
shoot' because the bombers are unable to defend themselves properly without
escort.<br>
To assure that enemy bomber formations will allways be escorted by enemy
fighters, it is necessary to use an &quot;Allied or Axis specific&quot;
Planes.dat file when playing a campaign.<br>
When flying a British or an Axis campaign you must rename PlanesUK.dat or
PlanesGR.dat respectively to Planes.dat. All three files : Planes.dat,
PlanesUK.dat and PlanesGR.dat are contained by the Flight.zip file.</p>
<p>You can use the .bat files also contained in the Flight.zip file to rename
PlanesUK.dat and PlanesGR.dat.<br>
Alies.bat will rename PlanesUK.dat and will make a safe copy of the default
Planes.dat.<br>
Axis.bat will rename PlanesGR.dat and will make a safe copy of the default
Planes.dat.<br>
Adefault.bat will remove the renamed Planes.dat and will make the default
Planes.dat available again.</p>
<p>Not renaming PlanesUK.dat or PlanesGR.dat will not cause other bugs than the
sometimes unescorted enemy bombers.</p>
<p>2) The &quot;Convoy Bug&quot;: this mysterious convoy near Malta is left over
from the default version of EAW. At present we don't know how to get rid of it!</p>
<p>The convoy may be assigned as a target in interdiction missions both for the
Axis and the British. This will happen only a few times in a full 60 mission
career. Your best option is to abort the mission, since there's not enough fuel
to reach the convoy and return safely to base (with possibly the Beaufighters as
an exception) - unless, of course, you want to practice your ditching and
swimming abilities and hope to get rescued.</p>
<p>Do not confuse this bogus convoy with the actual target convoys in the game.
You can tell if you get assigned a mission to a &quot;real&quot; convoy because
all the real convoys have code names given in capital letters, such as PEDESTAL
or CIRCE.</p>
<p>3) The cockpit of the Me 210A is created from pieces using different
standard-cockpits. It was not possible, due to the slot (262A), to add correct
cockpit gauges.</p>

<p>6. THE CAMPAIGN: DESERT AIR WAR 1941 - 1942</p>
<p>The 1941-1942 Desert Air War campaign replaces the 1940 Battle of Britain
campaign in EAW. It starts in April 1941, when Rommel and the German Afrika
Korps arrive in Tripoli, and ends in December 1942 with the Battle of el Alamein.
The aim of this campaign is to simulate the air and air to ground war in North
Africa between Axis (German and Italian) and British (and Commonwealth) air
forces.</p>
<p>Selecting a normal campaign, you fly a mission every 10 days with a total of
about 60 missions. It is not posible to fly a long campaign, as flying a mission
every 10 days seems fixed. Ofcourse by using a hex editor or campaign editor by
Rockphi you can change the Camp**40.dat file to fly a mission every 2 days if
you want and if you have that much time.</p>
<p>When you play this campaign DO NOT select Limited Supply or you may not have
bombs to carry. I would like to quote Charles Gunst on this : &quot;Did you join
up to be a fighter pilot or a supply clerk anyway?&quot; :-)<br>

<p>Remarks, problems and solutions</p>
<p>Flight models and plane characteristics are based on the superb ECA Panel by
Charles Gunst. However I made some adaptations as I also did in Pacific Tide,
Battle of Britain and the Ardennes.<br>
Defensive guns on bombers are given the same rate of fire, muzzle velocity and
range as the offensive guns of the same type on the fighters. To compensate for
their increased power the dispersion factor is larger and so results in less
accurate defensive fire.<br>
To prevent what the makers of the ECA Online flight models called
&quot;Shot-off-tail syndrome&quot;, I applied their solution: doubling the tail
hit points while halving the tail hit bubble size, both for fighters and
bombers.</p>
<p>The great Rendermod by max188 is applied so that planes retain better
visibility over larger distances.</p>
<p>The fuel burn rate is 1.5 (in the original EAW it is 1.0). Completely correct
fuel burn rate would be 2.0, but this leads to major problems with
computer-controlled planes as they cannot conserve their fuel. The value 1.5
leads to nice dropping fuel gauges while on mission, but retaining enough fuel
reserve to reach your homebase safely. Alt-N also conserves fuel.</p>
