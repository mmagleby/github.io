EAW Briefing Screen fix for WinXP

This describes how to fix the briefing screen and map corruption when using a GeForce card under NT.
Because the exact registry path of the fix is different on every system, it involves a bit of detective
work.  It then requires you to manually editing the Windows system registry.  While not particularly 
difficult, it can be very dangerous to your system's health if you are not careful.  So, please be 
careful!

1) Open Regedit

2) Navigate to:
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\HARDWARE\DEVICEMAP\VIDEO

3) Look for the name:
   \Device\Video0

4) Look at the cooresponding Data value.  It will look something like this:
   \Registry\Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Video\{52BE6E44-53E9-4A0B-AF3C-70A73F8AD1CE}\0000

5) Make note of the value in the brackets and the instance at the end of the line.  You may want to print 
   out this branch (cntrl-p) to easily reference these values later.  In this example it is:
   {52BE6E44-53E9-4A0B-AF3C-70A73F8AD1CE}\0000

6) Navigate to:
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Video

7) There may be several sub-categories.  Select the one that matches the value in the brackets you noted 
   in step 5.  In this example it is:
   {52BE6E44-53E9-4A0B-AF3C-70A73F8AD1CE}

8) Select the instance you noted in step 5.  In this example it is:
   \0000

9) Right-click this same instance (\0000) and select New/DWORD Value.  This will create a value called 
   "New Value #1".

10) Right click the "New Value #1" and rename it to NoAdjustedPitch.

11) Double-click the new NoAdjustedPitch and assign it a Hexadecimal value of 1.

13) Exit regedit and reboot.

14) The Briefing screens and maps should now be working properly.
